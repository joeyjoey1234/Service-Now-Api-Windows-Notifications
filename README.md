Service-now-popUupFinal.py
is the final 
popup for Active, no group assigned, INCIDENTS
and popup for active, calls awaiting triage, CALLS

I could not get the notifications to work in my domain enviroment, because notifications are blocked VIA group policy

Building the task bar app.py == 
has three methods i used to create these notifications they just need implementation into the final script

For now the final has a cmd start for firefox to open up its default browser and open the service now Table for ever 1 call/incident out of 100

If its a call it opens up the call table with the calls awaiting triage filter

For incident it opens up Active, no group assigned, INCIDENTS
